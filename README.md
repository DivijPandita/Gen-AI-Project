# Prompt-to-Story Generation using Transformer Models

This project demonstrates the use of Generative AI to create short, coherent stories from user-provided prompts. Built using Python, Hugging Face Transformers, and Gradio, it leverages the pre-trained GPT-2 model to produce creative narrative content in real time.

## 💡 How It Works

1. The user enters a prompt (e.g., *"I walked into the old house..."*)
2. The system sends the prompt to GPT-2 via the text-generation pipeline.
3. GPT-2 generates a short story (up to 200 tokens).
4. The story is displayed in the Gradio interface.

## 🧪 Example
Input:-
The wind howled through the trees as I entered the forest.

Output:-
The wind howled through the trees as I entered the forest.

I looked over at the trees. The one who was coming by said there were several people looking for him.

When I looked at the distance, I thought that one would be a little too late.

The wind picked up again. It had not stopped.

While the wind blew, I started to think that I may be able to take out some other things while I go.

But I wasn't able to take out anything.

It would be too heavy to run for a while.

This place was not just on the edge, this place was on the edge of the forest.

When I got there, the wind blew out and the wind was blowing up through the trees.

I looked around for something, but there wasn't anything.

Before I began to think, I saw a man with a silver robe.

A man who looked like a man with a silver robe.

He was wearing a green helmet, and a red tunic over his head.

He looked like he was about to run into a group of people.

I looked around. There were even a few guards in the center of the forest outside it.

"That's Captain
